### Project Summary:

Why this research is important:  Phantom limb pain and nerve injuries significantly impact quality of life. Immersive virtual reality and robotics have already shown exceptional potential, reducing pain for over 68% of patients in clinical trials. This project aims to refine and personalise rehabilitation therapies, combining cutting-edge technology to optimise recovery outcomes.

Who you will be working with:  You will collaborate with the Aspire CREATe team at UCL, experts in assistive technology and rehabilitation, and partner with the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre and the National Rehabilitation Centre. These partnerships provide access to leading-edge facilities and patient networks.

What you will be doing:  You will enhance the existing VR and robotic system by integrating neuroimaging techniques (e.g., EEG, OPM-MEG, fNIRS) to study brain activity during therapy. After identifying movement-related biomarkers, you will develop AI algorithms that tailor therapy in real time. The project also includes testing these innovations in clinical trials with spinal and nerve injury patients.

Who we are looking for:  We are seeking a motivated candidate with interests in AI, neuroimaging, and robotics. You should have a strong technical background and enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research that makes a real-world impact in healthcare.
