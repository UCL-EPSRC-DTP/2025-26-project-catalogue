### Project Summary:

Are you interested in cutting-edge chemistry with real-world applications? 
Our project explores the fascinating world of aza-macrocycles, unique molecules with the power to transform energy and environmental technology. We’re developing innovative synthetic methods to create smart membranes that respond to specific ions, offering groundbreaking solutions for clean energy, pollution control, and resource recovery.

Aza-macrocycles have shown great potential in sensing technologies, like zinc ion detection, and their powerful metal-binding capabilities make them ideal for next-generation membrane applications. Imagine membranes that can selectively allow certain ions, such as protons, lithium or rare earth metals (for energy and recovering applications), while blocking toxic ions like cadmium and lead (for sensing application). Through advanced molecular design, our project will refine these properties to target a wide range of ions, from simple alkali metals to rare and harmful elements.

Our interdisciplinary research brings together synthetic chemistry, materials science, and sustainable technology. You’ll gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge techniques, including neutron/X-ray scattering (at ISIS/Diamond, UK & ILL, France) as we explore how to incorporate functionalized aza-macrocycles into scalable membrane systems. By tuning their coordination properties, we aim to push beyond traditional oxygen-based membranes and achieve unparalleled selectivity and conductivity. We seek a passionate chemistry graduate with a background in organic synthesis and a keen interest in exploring molecular properties at the atomic scale. No previous experience in neutron/X-rays is required.

Join us to make a tangible impact on future technologies. This project offers a unique opportunity to work at the forefront of chemistry and sustainability, developing materials with the potential to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges. Are you ready to be part of the change?
