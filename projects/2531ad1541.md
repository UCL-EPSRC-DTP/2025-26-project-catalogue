### Project Summary:

Why this research is important:

Therapeutic nucleic acids are a revolutionary class of medicines capable of treating previously untreatable diseases by modulating gene expression. However, their widespread application is hindered by challenges such as fragility and poor cellular uptake, which require advanced delivery systems. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated their potential in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but they lack the precision to target specific tissues without modification. This research aims to develop an innovative delivery system that addresses these limitations, enabling precise delivery of nucleic acids to specific tissues such as the brain, heart, spleen, kidneys or salivary glands.

Who you will be working with
You will join a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in nanotechnology, polymer science, and therapeutic delivery. Collaborating with experts in cutting-edge molecular imprinting techniques and therapeutic nucleic acids, you will contribute to a project at the forefront of precision medicine.

What you will be doing
Your work will involve the design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP NPs) tailored to specific therapeutic targets. You will characterise these systems using advanced physico-chemical techniques to ensure stability and specificity. The project will also involve evaluating the biological performance of these nanoparticles in vitro and potentially in vivo. This hands-on experience will train you in the synthesis of advanced nanomaterials, molecular imprinting, and state-of-the-art biocharacterisation techniques.

Who we are looking for
We seek a highly motivated candidate with a background in chemistry, pharmacy, biology, materials science, bioengineering, or a related field. You should have a keen interest in therapeutic delivery systems and an aptitude for interdisciplinary research. Laboratory experience in chemistry and/or biology or related areas is advantageous but not essential. Enthusiasm for learning and contributing to groundbreaking research is key.
