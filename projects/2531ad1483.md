### Project Summary:

Retrofitting existing buildings is necessary for achieving energy efficiency and addressing the climate crisis. However, retrofits can fail or cause damage, if the materials in the retrofitted building envelope are not understood, affecting the durability of buildings and the health of their occupants. This research will identify effective non-destructive techniques for evaluating wall materials and use this information to improve simulations that predict retrofit performance and risks.

You will work with Dr Valentina Marincioni and Professor Hector Altamirano-Medina at UCL. Dr Marincioni is an expert in building physics, moisture and retrofit strategies, while Professor Altamirano-Medina specialises in environmental design and health, with expertise on mould in buildings.  The supervisory team is part of the UK Centre for Moisture in Buildings (UKCMB), a network which focuses on improving the health and durability of buildings.

The project combines laboratory experiments, in-situ non-destructive testing, and advanced hygrothermal modelling. You will characterise wall materials, test non-destructive methods for accuracy, and use this data to improve hygrothermal simulations. Your work will help designers make evidence-based decisions for safer, more durable retrofits.

We are looking for candidates with a background in engineering, physics, material science, or a related field. You should have a strong interest in building performance, sustainability, and hands-on experimental work. Experience with simulation tools or laboratory testing is desirable but not essential, as full training will be provided.
