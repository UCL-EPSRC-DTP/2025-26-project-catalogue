### Project Summary:

Indoor mould growth poses significant health risks and can lead to structural damage, costing billions in repairs and maintenance worldwide. Traditional mould prevention strategies, typically involving moisture control through ventilation and heating, can be costly, ineffective, or difficult to implement in certain environments. This innovative project investigates an emerging solution: using acoustic interventions to prevent mould growth. Leveraging recent findings suggesting that ultrasound frequencies may influence microbial behaviour, this project aims to explore whether sound could offer a non-chemical, low-maintenance alternative for mould prevention in buildings.
The project will examine various acoustic conditions and their effects on common indoor mould species found in the UK. Mould cultures will be exposed to different sound parameters, with growth rates and cellular changes carefully monitored. Experiments will be conducted at the IEDE Environmental and Acoustic Labs at UCL HERE EAST, utilizing state-of-the-art facilities to precisely control experimental conditions. Based on lab results, the most effective sound treatments will be applied in real-world environments prone to mould issues.
The goal of this research is to develop sound-based mould prevention systems that can be integrated into buildings where traditional moisture control strategies are insufficient or impractical. This approach will offer a sustainable, health-oriented solution for mould prevention. The project contributes to advancing sustainable building science and promotes healthier indoor environments.
We are seeking highly motivated candidates with a solid background in science, preferably in engineering or physics. Successful applicants will join a supervisory team with expertise in building physics, environmental acoustics, soundscape methodologies, mould growth, and humidity control.
