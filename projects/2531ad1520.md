### Project Summary:

Join UCL’s “Gender and Tech” Lab, part of the Information Security Research Group, to tackle technology-facilitated intimate partner abuse (“tech abuse”). Supported by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship, this PhD project reimagines online safety by creating pre-emptive interventions that target abusive behaviours at their core.

We’re seeking candidates passionate about using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for social impact. You’ll have the opportunity to lead original research, publish in top journals, and join a dynamic, interdisciplinary community with resources for meaningful collaboration and expertise.

In this role, you will use NLP to decode harmful language patterns and behaviours online, directly informing policy and safeguards. With HCI methods, you’ll investigate user experience, analyse interactions, and design protective interfaces to empower at-risk users. You will work with NGOs, policymakers, and industry experts to help shape standards, regulatory frameworks, and proactive digital interventions.

Ideal candidates will demonstrate:

[1] Technical Expertise in NLP, Machine Learning, and Ethical AI: Proficiency in text classification, information extraction, and deep learning models (e.g., transformers, BERT) using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Knowledge of ethical AI principles, including fairness, transparency, and accountability.

[2] HCI and User-Centred Design Knowledge: Experience or strong interest in designing accessible, secure, and intuitive interfaces for vulnerable users, with skills in user research and usability testing to ensure supportive technology.

[3] Research Independence and Methodological Rigour: Ability to define research questions, apply robust methodologies, manage large datasets, and work autonomously. Strong English writing skills and a commitment to publishing in peer-reviewed conferences and journals are essential.

Apply to drive meaningful, lasting change in the field of digital safety and tech abuse prevention.
