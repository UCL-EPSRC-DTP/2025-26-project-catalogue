### Project Summary:

Myelin is a critical protective layer produced by special brain cells called oligodendrocytes. It wraps around neuron fibres, allowing rapid transmission of electrical signals in the brain and spinal cord. Myelin damage is linked to numerous neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, autism, schizophrenia, and especially multiple sclerosis, where myelin loss severely impacts quality of life. Unfortunately, we still lack effective lab models to study myelination, as most existing systems grow cells on flat surfaces that fail to mimic the brain’s unique environment.

In this exciting interdisciplinary project, blending engineering and neuroscience, we’re pioneering a new approach. Using advanced microfabrication and hydrogel technology, we’ve created tiny, flexible structures that replicate the shape and feel of neuron fibres. These structures, known as micropillars, are designed to encourage human-derived myelin-producing cells to wrap around them naturally. This realistic model of myelination opens the door for testing drugs in a way that closely mirrors human biology.

Furthermore, our collaboration with a cutting-edge company specialising in AI and longevity research brings advanced data analysis to our project. By incorporating AI, we can analyse images, track cell behaviour, and optimise the platform for high-throughput drug screening. This project offers hands-on experience in bioengineering, neurobiology, high-resolution microscopy, and collaboration with industry leaders—perfect for a PhD student looking to make a real impact in neurodegenerative disease research and longevity science. Together, we aim to accelerate drug discovery for myelination disorders, ultimately improving treatment options and supporting healthy brain ageing.
