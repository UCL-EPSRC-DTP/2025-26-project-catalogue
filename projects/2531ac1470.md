### Project Summary:

Why this research is important. 

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize technology, impacting sectors from cryptography to pharmaceuticals. Realizing this potential requires breakthroughs in qubit scalability. Spin states in semiconductors are among the most stable qubits, and donor atoms in semiconductors are fundamentally identical, setting them apart for scalable quantum devices. This project will explore the fundamental science of atomic-scale germanium-based quantum systems, aiming to develop scalable quantum technology using advanced atomic-scale techniques.

Who you will work with. 

You will join a collaborative team at UCL, working closely with PhD and master’s students in the scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) lab. Prof. Schofield will directly supervise you, alongside experts in quantum device physics. Additionally, you will conduct experiments and participate in collaborative projects at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland’s largest research institute for natural and engineering sciences.

What you will be doing. 

Your work will use cryogenic STM and advanced photoelectron methods to study quantum device fabrication in germanium. You will position donor atoms with atomic precision to create two-, one-, and zero-dimensional quantum devices for scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, photoelectron, and electronic transport measurements. Your research will also utilise PSI’s SLS 2.0 synchrotron for EUV patterning and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.

Who we are looking for. 

We are looking for a motivated researcher with a background in physics or materials science. Ideal candidates have strong analytical skills and a collaborative approach. Training will be provided, but an enthusiasm for atomic-scale science is essential.
