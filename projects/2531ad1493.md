### Project Summary:

This proposal aims to revolutionise sustainable biomanufacturing by engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae to perform CO₂ recycling, minimising carbon loss and emissions, and pioneering CO₂ as a feedstock. By creating yeast strains capable of capturing and converting their CO₂ emissions into valuable products, this project aims to significantly reduce carbon waste and dependence on traditional feedstocks, positioning yeast as a key driver for carbon-neutral production.

Our vision is to develop a scalable microbial platform that transforms biomanufacturing processes, significantly reducing carbon emissions and unlocking opportunities for sustainable chemicals, biomaterials, and alternative foods. This project addresses a critical challenge in fermentation, where up to one-third of carbon feedstock is lost as CO₂, impacting both sustainability and economic efficiency. Additionally, our more ambitious goal is to utilise CO₂ as an alternative feedstock to tackle the challenge of expensive raw materials.

Guided by a leading interdisciplinary team, this project will blend metabolic and bioprocess engineering expertise (Dr Rios, UCL BiochemEng) and cutting-edge computational biology tools (Dr Fedorec, UCL Biosciences). 

The student will receive extensive training in engineering biology, enzymatic carbon capture, computational biology, and bioprocessing, gaining skills that span from modelling lab work to strategic industry engagement. This research aligns with the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy/Net Zero ambitions, making it timely and impactful. By advancing carbon-recycling microbial factories, this project aims to redefine sustainability in biomanufacturing and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.
