### Project Summary:

To revolutionise the construction industry, this project explores the engineering, implementation and use of collective autonomous robots and sustainable additive manufacturing processes to create scalable, efficient, and environmentally conscious building solutions that redefine how we create and maintain our Built Environment in the 21st century. This moon-landing project, builds upon UKRI funding that has led to publications in Nature (2022) and Science Robotics (2019), offering a unique opportunity for a student to engage in cutting-edge research at the forefront of autonomous sustainable robotic construction technologies. The project involves developing intelligent multi-agent robotic systems capable of autonomously constructing complex structures. Combining aerial and ground-based robots, the research will explore how teams of machines can collaborate to handle materials, perform precise additive manufacturing, and ensure quality control—entirely without human intervention. This approach is expected to provide a step change to traditional construction, reducing costs, timelines, and environmental impacts while enabling infrastructure development in remote and challenging environments.

The project emphasizes research into material sustainability by using eco-friendly materials such as bio-based composites, geopolymers, and recycled aggregates. By working in multi-disciplinary team, students will evaluate these materials for their performance in multi-agent robotic construction and explore innovative ways to integrate adaptive robotic control for optimal material use. A lifecycle assessment will quantify environmental benefits, ensuring the research contributes to the UK's commitment to a low-carbon future.

Students will benefit from access to world-class facilities at UCL HereEast, EMPA’s DroneHub, and the University of Pennsylvania’s Autonomous Manufacturing Lab. Collaborations with leading industry partners such as ARUP, Atkins, and Foster + Partners will provide hands-on experience and exposure to real-world applications through field trials.
This project not only offers the chance to contribute to novel UKRI-supported research but also positions students as leaders in sustainable construction and robotics—a growing field with global significance. With direct links to cutting-edge science and industry innovation, this is a rare opportunity to be at the forefront of transforming the construction industry for a sustainable future.
