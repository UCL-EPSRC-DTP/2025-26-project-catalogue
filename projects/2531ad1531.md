### Project Summary:

Muscles are the engines of movement and the essence of animal behaviour. While we understand much about their development, physiology, and regeneration, recreating functional muscle systems from cellular and extracellular components remains a challenge. Our cutting-edge research project offers an exciting opportunity to pioneer advancements in this field, blending advanced materials, biology, engineering, and robotics.

Building on our recent breakthroughs in hybrid artificial muscles derived from human pluripotent stem cells and elastomer nanofibers, this project aims to develop 3D muscle-like bio-actuators for next-generation bio-robots, muscle regeneration, and reconstruction. We will engineer photonic-crystal (PC) micro-/nano-structured scaffolds using photo-responsive elastomers to mimic the intricate interplay between muscle tissue and motor neuron input. These scaffolds will be systematically designed, fabricated, and characterized for their optical and mechanical properties, and their interaction with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived muscle cells will be studied.

By incorporating optogenetic control and advanced material science, we will investigate how muscle cells proliferate, differentiate, and contract under light stimulation, comparing the results with aligned nanofiber scaffolds. The ultimate goal is to assemble these constructs into bio-robots with functional musculoskeletal systems, paving the way for innovations in semi-biological robotic systems, bio-robotic implants, and surgical tools.

If you are passionate about bioengineering, regenerative medicine, or robotics, and are eager to explore the convergence of biology and technology, we invite you to join our multidisciplinary team and make a transformative impact in this groundbreaking field.
