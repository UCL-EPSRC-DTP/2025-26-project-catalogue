### Project Summary:

This project aims to design and evaluate adaptive, digital environments that help adolescents safely explore identity while growing mental resilience. This project explores how digital environments can support adolescents' translation into adulthood by leveraging Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles combined with public mental health approaches. We will explore the role of digital spaces and how they can support the exploration and formation of adolescent identity through playful design and how digital behavioural markers can be applied to raise awareness about mental health needs. The goal is to understand how digital social spaces can positively influence adolescents' mental well-being and identity formation by creating safe, engaging virtual spaces.
Objectives
•	Identify early digital behavioural markers for mental health needs: Develop and implement techniques that respond to indicators for mental health needs (e.g., facial expressions, hesitation, engagement levels) and explore ways to offer Just-in-the-Moment Adaptive Interventions 
•	Encourage Positive Identity Exploration: Analyse features that allow adolescents to experiment with self-identity, such as customizable self-representations, narrative choices, and social scenarios that reflect diverse, inclusive representations.
•	Evaluate Psychological and Social Outcomes: Assess the effects of these adaptive games on social anxiety levels, identity development, and overall mental well-being through longitudinal studies with adolescent participants.
•	Develop Best Practices for Safe Digital Environments: Generate guidelines for designing digital social environments that support adolescent mental health, drawing from data on playful interactions, mental health need responses, and identity exploration.
Expected Impact
The project will contribute to safer, psychologically supportive digital environments tailored to adolescents, promoting healthy identity exploration and providing real-time support for mental health needs. This research will pave the way for future studies on digital interventions for youth mental health, offering a model for how digital platforms can positively impact well-being in an increasingly digital age.
