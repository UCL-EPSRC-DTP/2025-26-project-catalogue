### Project Summary:

Background
Surgeons often face challenges in distinguishing between different tissue types during operations, such as identifying tumour margins in cancer surgeries or visualizing nerves in maxillofacial procedures to avoid inadvertent damage. HSI offers a non-invasive solution by capturing detailed spectral information from tissues, revealing unique signatures that can differentiate healthy tissue from diseased tissue or critical anatomical structures.
However, current HSI technology has limitations:
•	Existing HSI systems often sacrifice spatial detail to capture extensive spectral information, making it difficult to visualize fine anatomical structures.
•	The vast amount of data generated requires significant computational power, hindering real-time application in surgery.
•	Surgeons need intuitive tools to interpret hyperspectral data quickly during operations.

Project Goals
This project aims to overcome these challenges through cutting-edge AI research:
1.	Develop algorithms that enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images, allowing for detailed visualization of critical structures.
2.	Create efficient data processing techniques and machine learning models for rapid tissue classification and visualization.
3.	Validate the enhanced HSI system across various surgical domains.
4.	Design intuitive interfaces and visualization tools that seamlessly integrate with existing surgical equipment and workflows.
