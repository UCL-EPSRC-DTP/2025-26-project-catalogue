### Project Summary:

As applications of Quantum technologies in particular for quantum sensing and quantum computing are becoming more prevalent a number of issues are remaining in terms of temperature of operation and energy consumption. Photons with higher energy, well above the thermal noise floor at higher temperature are a logical choice to create quantum system that could operate at higher temperatures. However, at the exception of single photon and entangled photons sources there is still little development in offering integrated on chip systems for quantum manipulation.
The PhD research will focus on developing such technology including both active and passive devices and leveraging the recent developments of photonic integration foundries. 
It will benefit from our state-of-the-art facilities for characterising those photonic integrated chips. The work will focus on photon frequencies ranging from the hundreds of gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz, with a particular interest in reducing losses and noise within the system to enable better efficiency in the overall quantum system. While the primary aspect the work will be on developing the photonic integrated chip technology and demonstrate simple on chip quantum state manipulation, we fully expect the research to develop beyond that demonstration and look into one particular application field of quantum technologies, such as demonstrating multiple Q-bits operation.
