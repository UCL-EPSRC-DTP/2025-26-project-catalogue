### Project Summary:

Why this Research is Important: 
Over 3 million people worldwide rely on upper-limb prosthetics, but many of these devices offer limited control and lack sensory feedback, making even simple tasks challenging. This lack of realistic tactile sensation contributes to high abandonment rates, with up to 40% of users discontinuing use due to poor functionality and discomfort. This project aims to address these issues by developing a robotic prosthetic hand that provides a realistic sense of touch. By implementing a novel bioimpedance-based control system to interpret muscle signals, combined with wearable haptic devices for real-time tactile feedback, we aim to enhance the usability of prosthetics. This integration seeks to bridge the gap between artificial prosthetic manipulation and natural human hand function, improving control and comfort for users and ultimately enhancing their quality of life.

Who You Will Be Working With: 
You will join a multidisciplinary team of experts in bioengineering, bioelectronics, robotics, and sensory feedback technologies. This collaborative setting provides access to state-of-the-art research facilities, guidance from academic leaders, and insight from industry.

What You Will Be Doing: 
Your role will focus on developing a bioimpedance-sensory system to enable precise, user-friendly prosthetic control and designing wearable haptic devices and electronics that provide natural, real-time feedback. Key tasks include creating soft-silicon haptic interfaces, microelectronic bioimpedance systems, robotic hands with a sense of touch and testing the systemâ€™s usability with real prosthetic subjects. 

Who We Are Looking For: 
We are looking for a dedicated student with a background in electronic/mechanical engineering, computer science, or a related field and a strong interest in prosthetic technologies. Strong familiarity with bioengineering, microelectronics, biosignal processing or robotics is beneficial, but a willingness to learn and tackle interdisciplinary challenges is most important. Strong analytical skills, creativity, and a commitment to improving prosthetic functionality are essential for this role.
